# Craft Demo Script

Before each section, use Alfred to run `craftdemo 01`. This will discard unsaved git changes, create a new branch from the passed tag (e.g. 01, 02), and update the local database data.


## Prologue: Why Craft?

- **Sweetspot Feature Set:** first-class support for most common scenarios, but not bloated with crap.
- **Flexibility:** Craft is built around some key concepts – sections, fields, entries, relationships – that are very flexible. It's pretty easy to fit craft to the needs of most projects.
- **Templating:** Craft uses Twig, a robust templating language that is pretty nice to work with. No PHP in templates. Very designer-friendly.
- **Support:** The Craft support team is great,and the community is growing fast.
- **Routing:** Craft comes with built in support for Routing, including a simple, easy-to-understand set of default routes, and the ability to easily define custom routes in a way that actually makes sense.
- **ExpressionEngine Legacy:** Pixel & Tonic made the best EE plugins for many years, and they've brought all of that experience to Craft. Craft includes pretty much all of the features of their EE plugins by default, including matrix and relationships. It also borrows from the good EE concepts while throwing the many bad ones away.


## 01: Fresh Download

Completely fresh, untouched Craft Download.

- Briefly explain how the default Craft folder structure works, and the most common way to prep it for development.
- Move contents of `/public` folder into root.
- Open `index.php` and change `$craftPath = '../craft';` to `$craftPath = 'craft';`
- Open `/craft/config/general.php` and add `'omitScriptNameInUrls' => true` to the array.
- Rename `htaccess` to `.htaccess`. Combined with the above, this will remove `index.php` from URLs.


## 02: Installation, Routes, Templates, and Sections

Includes a fully-built-out project structure, ready for Craft installation.

- We're using Gulp for a basic task runner and server. Handles Sass compilation, LiveReload, etc.
- `npm install`
- `gulp`

- I've already created a MySQL database called `craft_demo`
- `/craft/config/db.php` is where we define our database connection. You can also set this to be unique to each dev, staging, and production server environment, which we'll talk about later. For now we've just set this to connect to a local MySQL server.

- Visit [http://http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/](http://http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/) and go through install process.
- Assign username `admin` and password `password`
- Talk a bit about the Dashboard, including how you can customize it.

- Go back to [http://dev.craft-demo.com/](http://dev.craft-demo.com/).

- Open `/craft/templates` in Sublime Text.
- For the route URL route, Craft automatically looks for an `index.html` file. Let's look at that file.
- Craft templates use the concept of `blocks` for templating.
- Several things are happening in this file:
    1. We're _extending_ `_layout.html`, which means we want to use that as a wrapper for this template.
    2. We're defining the markup that should appear in the `content` block.
    3. We're displaying the `heading` and `body` fields for this _Entry_
    4. We're looping through all entries in the _News_ section, limit to 5 entries, and displaying them.

Let's talk about each of things things individually real quick:

### Extending and blocks:

- Open `/craft/templates/_layout.html`
- If we scroll down and look in `<main id="content">`, we see `{% block content}`
- Notice how that block has the same name that we saw in `index.html`? When we extended `_layout.html`, we said "Replace any blocks in that template with the blocks defined in this file, then render that template". 
- If a block is defined in the layout, but not in the template, it will use the default block content form the layout. That's what we see inside the `{% block content}` of `_layout.html`
- If we look at the default `404.html` template, we can see it's basically doing the same thing as `index.html`, just defining different block content.
- `404.html` is also passing a `title` variable up to the layout. If we look in the layout we can see that it is checking for a `title` variable, and if it finds it will prepend it to the site name.

### Outputting Entry Fields

- Twig, the templating language used by Craft, has two types of tags: `{% %}` and `{{ }}`
- If you're familiar with other templating languages these shouldn't be too difficult to understand.
- `{% %}` runs code without outputting it, similar to `<% %>` in erb.
- `{{ }}` outputs the results, similar to `<%= %>` in erb.
- The `{{ entry.heading }}` and `{{ entry.body }}` tags are taking the current entry, looking for fields called `heading` and `body`, and outputting them.
- But what is an entry? How does the template know what entry to work with?
- Go to [http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/dashboard](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/dashboard) and click `Entries`
- Turns out there is a an entry called `Homepage`. Every Craft site has one (and only one) Homepage entry, and Craft knows to use it when displaying the index route.

### Entries and Entry Routes

- Back on the site's index, we saw that it was looping through all News entries and displaying them.
- If we click on one of the news items, we can see that it uses the same layout and the URL is `/news/2014/we-just-installed-craft`.
- When craft sees this URL, it looks for a directory in `/craft/templates` called `news`, then it looks within that for a `_entry.html` template to use for display the entry content.
- If we look in `/news/_entry.html`, there's nothing in here that we haven't seen before. It's extending `_layout.html` and setting the `content` block with the details of the entry.
- If we view the [entry in the Craft Admin](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/entries/news/3), we can see that it has a `title` and `body`.
- It also has a few details that `Homepage` didn't, because Homepage is what Craft calls a _Single_ entry, meaning there is only one of them in the site and they usually match a single page of the site, while `News` is a _Channel_ entry, meaning there's probably a bunch of them.
- If we click `Live Preview` we get a live editing view of the entry.

### Adding new entries

- Let's add a News entry. Go to `Entries`, then click `New Entry`. Give it some details, then click Save. We'll see out new entry.
- When we were looking at our templates, we also saw an `index.html` route in `/templates/news`.
- If we visit [http://dev.craft-demo.com/news/](http://dev.craft-demo.com/news/), Craft knows that we're not looking at an individual entry, so it shows the index route for the `News` section.
- You can probably guess what that template is doing. It's just looping through all news items and displaying them.

### Sections

- So what are Homepage and News? How does Craft know what fields we want them to include?
- They are both sections, and we can find out more about them by visiting [http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/settings](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/settings) and clicking on `Sections`.
- We see our two sections, we can see their `type`, a preview of their route format, etc.
- If we click on `Homepage`, we'll see that we can edit everything about it. We can also see that the template it uses is customizable, it just happens to use `index` by default.
- If we edit the `News` section, we'll see that we also also edit the format of its route. One of the cool things about Craft is that most admin fields can include tags, so here we're using the `postDate` and `slug` properties of each entry to build its route.

### Fields

- Every section entry has `fields`, like `title`, `body`, etc.
- We set which fields we want a section entry to include by editing its Entry types.
- Section Entry Types offer a lot of flexibility: for instance, the News section could include both `Weather` and `Crime` Entry types. Entry types are essentially just a way of organizing, and aren't necessary. In fact, much of the time you won't even need more than one entry type for a section.
- Click 'Edit entry types` next to the `News` section, then edit the one existing entry type.
- Here we have the ability to add, remove, or rearrange the fields used by News. If your entry type has a lot of content, you can even get more organized by adding multiple tabs, but you usually won't need to.
- You can also set fields as being required.

### Adding a new field
- Let's say we want to add a new `location` field to News.
- Go to the [Settings > Fields](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/settings/fields) area, then click `New Field`.
- Call the field `location`, add some helpful instructions, and set the placeholder type. While we're here take a look at the many different field types, a few of which we'll talk about later.
- Click `Save`. Now we need to tell the News section to use this field.
- Go back to [Settings > Sections > News > Edit Entry Types](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/settings/sections/2/entrytypes/2) and we'll see a new `Location` field under `Default`. Just drag it up to our Field Layout, and click `Save`.
- Now if we go to `Entries` and edit one of our News entries, we'll see our new `location` field ready to use.
- To output this, we'd just add an `{{ entry.location }}` tag to any of our News templates.


## 03: Getting ready to build out a static site.

To save time, I've done a few things behind the scenes since we last left-off:

- Copies a bunch of template files into `/styles`, `/scripts`, `/images`, and `/craft/templates`.
- Created a `/templates/includes` folder to break up the markup a little bit.
- If we take a look at our new `/craft/templates/_layout.html`, we see that its now a super simple file with a bunch of includes. These includes work pretty much as you expect. It's also possible to pass local variables into an include, similarly to how to passed variables _up_ to the layout template.
- We also deleted all traces of the previous `News` section, including templates.

## 04: Building out the homepage entry.

Now let's go through how we converted this static template to Craft.

### The Heading Callout

- We have a heading, subhead, and background image.
- The heading and subhead are easy, we just added `featuredHeading` and `featuredSubhead` fields to the Homepage section.
- Notice that we created a "Homepage" Fields subgroup to keep things a little bit more organized. This is really just for organizational purposes, it doesn't affect how you use Fields in any way.

### Featured Image Asset

- We haven't yet talked about adding images. Craft makes it really easy to upload and work with files, which it calls _Assets_. Images are just another type of asset to craft, but there are some unique things you can do with images, like transforms.
- The first thing we're going to do is update `/craft/config/general.php` with some environment specific config.
- We haven't talked about Environment Configs yet, but this is a good time to go into it.
- If we open that file, we can see that we added a couple items to the array. Each of these is just checking for a URL pattern, and applying environment-specific settings/variables as necessary. You can use the exact same pattern in `db.php` to apply environment specific database connection settings.
- The `siteURL` and `fileSystemPath` variables we've defined here can also be set in the Admin UI, but by defining them here we can easily set them per-environment and keep them in version control.
- Now let's go to [Settings > Assets](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/settings/assets) in the admin.
- I've added a source called just _Images_. For this demo I'm going to keep all images in one asset source, but for a real project you'd probably have one source for _Portfolio Images_, one for _PDFs_, another for _News Images_, etc.
- For the _File System Path_ and _URL_ I'm using the variables I set in `general.php`.
- If you were using assets subpaths, you'd probably use something like `{fileSystemPath}portfolio/` and `{siteUrl}{fileSystemPath}portfolio/` here.
- We also need to make sure we have an `/assets/images` directory for these uploads to go in.

### Featured Image Transforms

- We can also set some image transforms. Transforms are a way to automatically grab scaled, cropped, or compressed images from the original uploaded source. It makes it so that your client can upload fullsize, uncompressed source images and you can be sure that you display them at a specific size. I've added a transform here specifically for our homepage featured image, which automatically scales and crops it to our desired size.

### Featured Image Field

- Now that we have a place to store our images, we needed to add a field to our Homepage section to assign the featured image.
- I went to [Settings > Fields](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/settings/fields), and added a new Field to the Default Group.
- I called this simply _Image_, because we may be using it for images besides on the homepage, and you can reuse the same field in as many sections as you want.
- For the _Field Type_, I chose _Assets_, and I limited the selection only to the source I just added. I also restricted the allowed file type to _Image_, and set a limit of 1 upload.
- Finally, I went to [Our Homepage Entry Type](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/settings/sections/1/entrytypes/1) and added the _Image_ field we just created.
- Now I can edit the [Homepage Entry](http://dev.craft-demo.com/admin/entries/homepage/2) and upload an image.
- In the `/includes/header.html` template, we just need to add a few tags.
- `{% set image = entry.image.first() %}` just sets a variable to the first image in this entries `image` field. The `.first()` is necessary because entries can have multiple assets uploaded to one field, we just happened to limit to 1 in this case.
- Next, in the `<img src=""…` we added `{{ image.getUrl('homepageFeatured') }}`. This code is a little more complicated than the most basic case, because we're requesting a transformed image. If Craft hasn't already generated and cached this transformed image, it will do so the first time it is requested.
- Now if we visit our [homepage](http://dev.craft-demo.com/), we can see that everything works great.

## 05: Building out the portfolio entries.

Now we're going to see how to build out and loop through these portfolio items.

### Adding the Portfolio fields and section

- First, we created a new field group called _Portfolio_, and added the following fields to it:
	- `portfolioImages`: Any number of image assets
- Then we went into [Settings > Sections](http://dev.craft-demo.com/index.php/admin/settings/sections) and created a new Portfolio section with the type _Channel_ and the default slugs and templates.
- Then we edited the only Portfolio entry type and added our `portfolioImages` field, and also the `body` field from General to use as a description.
- I created a few portfolio entries to work with.
- Then I went into `/craft/templates/index.html` and add a loop to output all projects.
- We can use `{{ entry.url }}` to automatically output the full URL path to this entry.
- Next we need an index and entry template for the Portfolio. For the entry template I just created a simple two-column layout for now.
- For the index, I added a portfolio index link to `/templates/includes/header.html` and added some code to automatically set a current class based on the URL segment.
- Then I adjusted the `/portfolio/index.html` template to output projects in exactly the same way we did in `index.html`

## 06: Relations and Matrix

The last thing I want to cover as quickly as possible are the Relation and Matrix abilities of Craft, which are both pretty unique differentiators.

### Relations

The concept of relations is simple: there is an "entries" field type, which you can assign to any entry, and add as many entries to it as you'd like. It works very similarly to adding assets to an entry.

You can limit the number of related entries, limit the section type of related entries, etc.

Let's see what this looks like by adding Related Projects to each portfolio entry.

- In the _Portfolio_ fields group, I created a new field called _Related Projects_, set the _Field Type_ to _Entries_, and limited the source to _Portfolio_ entries.
- After I saved the field, I added it as a field on _Portfolio_ section entries types.
- Now, when you edit or add any Portfolio entry, you'll see a _Related Projects_ field that you can easily add any number of entries to.
- Outputting these  related entries is incredibly easy. In our `/templates/portfolio/_entry.html` template, we just added the following:

```
{% for project in entry.relatedProjects.find() %}

  <section class="box">
    {% set image = project.portfolioImages.first() %}
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}" class="image image-full"><img src="{{ image.getUrl('portfolioEntry') }}" alt="" /></a>
    <header>
      <h3>{{ project.title }}</h3>
    </header>
    <p>{{ project.body }}</p>
    <footer>
      <a href="{{ entry.url }}" class="button alt">View Project</a>
    </footer>
  </section>
  
{% endfor %}
```

### Matrix

Matrix is the single most unique feature of Craft as a CMS. It's one of those things that takes a bit to wrap your head around, but once you realize what it is capable of it opens up entirely new doors for content generation, particularly for editorial style mixed content.

For the purposes of this demo, let's say for each extended project description we wanted to include any of the following:

- Copy
- Quotes
- List of Related Projects

Let's also say we want to be able to include each of those in any quantity, in any order, and make it all easily editable by a client with no risk of them breaking anything.

- First, we'll need to create  Matrix field for our portfolio entries.
- When the _Field Type_ is set to Matrix, we see a new area for Configuring the Matrix.
- A block type is just a type of content, in our case: Copy, Quote, or Paragraph
- We need to create a new block type for each of these. You can think of each Block type as a mini entry, which can then include any number of fields.
- Once we've created the matrix field and added it to the section entry type, we can edit any of our portfolio entries and see our new _Extended Description_ matrix. We can add any number of blocks, and set their order.
- Using the matrix in our markup is pretty easy. We just loop over the matrix blocks just like we would loop over relations:

```
{% for block in entry.extendedDescription %}
  {% if block.type == "copy" %}

    <p>{{ block.copyContent }}</p>

  {% elseif block.type == "quote" %}

    <p class="quote">{{ block.quoteContent }}</p>

  {% elseif block.type == "relatedProjects" %}
    
    <div class="extended-description-projects">
      {% for project in block.projectsContent.find() %}
        <a href="{{ project.url }}" class="extended-description-project">
          {% set image = project.portfolioImages.first() %}
          <img src="{{ image.getUrl('portfolioEntry') }}" alt="" />
          <h3>{{ project.title }}</h3>
        </a>
      {% endfor %}
    </div>

  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```
